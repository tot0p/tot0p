# About Me

<div class="about-content">

{{ author.bio.en }}

## My Journey

I started my journey in software development with a passion for creating tools that make people's lives easier. Over the years, I've developed a strong interest in automation, web development, and open-source contributions.

## What I Do

I specialize in creating GitHub Actions and automation tools that help developers streamline their workflows. My projects focus on:

- **GitHub Actions**: Building custom actions for repository management and README automation
- **Developer Tools**: Creating utilities that enhance the development experience
- **Open Source**: Contributing to the community through well-documented, maintainable code

## My Approach

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that others can understand and build upon. Every project I work on is an opportunity to learn something new and share that knowledge with the community.

## Skills & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- **Tools & Platforms**: Git, GitHub Actions, Docker, Node.js
- **Specialties**: Automation, API integration, web development
- **Methodologies**: Agile development, test-driven development, documentation-first approach

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and helping other developers solve interesting problems. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow.
