# About Me

<div class="about-content">

{{ author.bio.en }}

## My Journey

I started my software development journey with a passion for creating tools that make people's lives easier. Over the years, I developed a strong interest in automation, software development, and open-source contributions.

## What I Do

I specialize in building GitHub Actions and automation tools that help developers streamline their workflows. My projects focus on:

- **GitHub Actions**: Creating custom actions for repository management and README automation
- **Developer Tools**: Building utilities that enhance the development experience
- **Open Source**: Contributing to the community through well-documented and maintainable code

## My Approach

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that others can understand and improve. Every project I work on is an opportunity to learn something new and share that knowledge with the community.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with other developers, discussing new ideas, or collaborating on interesting projects. Feel free to reach out through any of the channels below:

- **LinkedIn**: [{{ author.linkedin }}]({{ author.linkedin }})
- **GitHub**: [{{ author.github }}]({{ author.github }})
